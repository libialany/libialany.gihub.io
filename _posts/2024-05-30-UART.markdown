### Description
<p style="font-size: 15px;">
Curious to learn more about data transmission protocols, I performed UART/serial communication between two ESP32 boards using the UART hardware library of the Arduino IDE. I debugged this using 2 esp32 and a LED. The serial port, known as Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter (UART) Communication, is widely used for most sensors and systems. To share workload, information, and perform various tasks, communication between two ESP32 boards is sometimes necessary.

## Hadware

<p>
- 330 ohm resistor
- 2 ESP32 boards
- Protoboard
- Wires
</p>

## Steps:

Follow the provided sketch and diagram.

We only transmit a single character (1 or 0). However, you can extend this to send longer messages. This is the result of this project.

## Conclusion:

This project is an excellent starting point for learning the basics of communication. There are other protocols, such as I2C and SPI, which I discussed in a podcast.

## Lastly

Never give up your dreams...
