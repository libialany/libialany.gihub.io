### Description
<p style="font-size: 15px;">1. What is an Automotive Bus System?

In this article, we provide a brief description of synthetic data, highlighting two important points: why synthetic data is valuable and what the future holds for synthetic data.</p>


1. **Why Choose Synthetic Data?**

Service providers gain significant benefits from accessing individual-level data safeguarded by governments or organizations. However, releasing more granular (disaggregated) data to the public risks exposing individuals represented in that data to privacy violations. This risk has been exacerbated by increased computing power and the development of powerful new statistical methods.

Data curators, the guardians of an organization‚Äôs data, must navigate these heightened risks when deciding which datasets or statistics to release publicly. They must also determine how to obscure private information before these releases, often referred to as anonymizing the data to not compromising personal privacy.

Data synthesis offers a robust solution. This statistical technique allows data curators to release record-level data while maintaining privacy protections, much like creating a convincing replica of a priceless artifact. Stakeholders can explore and benefit from this synthetic data, obtaining the information they need without jeopardizing individual privacy.

**Stronge privacy**

Imagine synthetic data as a photograph; it can be a partial snapshot or a complete picture.

Synthetic data can be either partially or fully synthetic. Partially synthetic data synthesizes only some columns of a dataset, typically the most sensitive ones from a privacy perspective.

Fully synthetic data offers stronger privacy protections than partially synthetic data, but preserving the dataset's properties becomes more challenging in the full synthesis process.

**GANS**

According to the paper "Data Generation of Time-Series Medical Records" by the University of Applied ciences Hamm-Lippstadt, Germany.


State-of-the-art GAN-based models for synthetic data generation to generate time-series synthetic medical records of dementia patients which can be distributed without privacy concerns.

Some research adds valuable insights into synthetic data using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs).

Generating synthetic data depends on the type of data you want to create. I used the SDV library to generate synthetic data for the Iris dataset.

2. **The Future of Synthetic Data?**

In my opinion, a particularly relevant and recent shift in disclosure limitation practice among some statistical agencies is the desire to formalize privacy and confidentiality (P&C) mathematically. This shift is evident in the invention of differential privacy and its variants.
