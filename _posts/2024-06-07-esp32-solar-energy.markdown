## IoT-Based Solar Power Monitoring System with ESP32

The monitoring of performance of solar power systems becomes interesting. An IoT-based solar power monitoring system can provide real-time data and insights into the functioning of a solar panel setup. 

This article explores the integration of various components, including the ESP32 microcontroller, voltage sensor module, LM35 temperature sensor, and LDR (Light Dependent Resistor), to create an efficient solar power monitoring system.

## ESP32 Microcontroller

The ESP32 is a powerful and versatile microcontroller. In this project, the ESP32 serves as the central unit, collecting data from different sensors, processing it, and transmitting it to a ThingthingSpeak. Its low power consumption and ability to enter deep sleep modes make it ideal for solar-powered applications, ensuring minimal energy usage.

## Voltage Sensor Module

The voltage sensor module is used to measure the voltage output from the solar panels. This module typically consists of a voltage divider circuit that steps down the high voltage from the solar panels to a lower, manageable level that the ESP32 can safely read. The voltage sensor provides real-time data on the panel‚Äôs output, which is crucial for assessing the performance and efficiency of the solar power system.

**Integration:** The voltage sensor module is connected to one of the analog input pins of the ESP32. The ESP32 reads the analog voltage value, converts it to the actual voltage.

## LM35 Temperature Sensor

- The LM35 is a precision temperature sensor. In a solar power monitoring system, the LM35 can monitor the temperature of the solar panels, as excessive heat can affect their efficiency and lifespan.

**Integration:** The LM35 is connected to another analog input pin on the ESP32. The ESP32 reads the analog voltage from the LM35, converts it to a temperature value using the sensor‚Äôs specifications, and includes this data in the monitoring system. 

## LDR (Light Dependent Resistor)

- An LDR is a resistor whose resistance changes with the intensity of light falling on it. This information helps in analyzing the correlation between light intensity and the solar panel‚Äôs output, and can also be used to adjust the position of the panels for maximum efficiency (if used in a solar tracking system).

**Integration:** The LDR is connected to another analog input pin on the ESP32. The resistance of the LDR changes with the light intensity, affecting the voltage at the analog input pin. The ESP32 reads this voltage, converts it to a light intensity value, and uses this data to analyze the performance of the solar panels under different lighting conditions.
