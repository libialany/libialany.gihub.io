## SQS


why we use SQS?

Because is a message service queue.


## Steps

[script](https://github.com/libialany/aws-notas/blob/main/SQS/send_messages.py)

Create scale-out and scale-in alarms using SQS 

Go to CloudWatch> Alarms>Create alarm

The metric to choose is: ApproximateNumberOfMessagesVisible metric.

Settings are: 

> scale-in to get activated 

Conditions:
Greater 500 messages but it has to check every minute.

> scale-out to get activated 

Conditions:
