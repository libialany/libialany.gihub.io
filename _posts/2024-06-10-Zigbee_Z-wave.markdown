### Description
<p style="font-size: 15px;">
These protocols enabling devices to communicate with each other.
</p>

## Introducing the Zigbee

Zigbee is an IEEE 802.15.4-based specification designed for creating personal area networks with small, low-power digital radios. It‚Äôs commonly used in home automation, medical device data collection, and other applications that require low-power and low-bandwidth communication.

## Introducing the Z-wave

Z-Wave is a wireless communication protocol primarily used for residential and commercial building automation. It operates as a mesh network using low-energy radio waves, enabling seamless device-to-device communication and control over various smart home devices.

## Diferencess

Z-Wave and Zigbee each has its own unique characteristics.

<h3>Z-wave</h3>

<p>
- Communication: Reliable via mesh network.
- Frequency Band: Uses the less congested 900 MHz band.
</p>

<h3>Zigbee</h3>

<p>- Communication: Longer range, potential for network congestion.
Frequency Band: Operates in the crowded 2.4 GHz band.
</p>

## Conclusion

I learned a bit about those two protocols and their differences. I chose not to mention the cost, as it varies dynamically, as well as the types of devices that use these protocols.

## Lastly

Do not stop to be curios.üßëüèª‚Äçüé§
